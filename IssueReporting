## Issue Reporting

There are different type of issues you can report, from bugs in the code to documentation issues. 
To report an issue go to the  Issues tab and press "New Issue". 
Each issue must have a label assigned so it can be easier to understand and work on it. Some of the most important labels available are:
- _Bug_: When something isn't working.
- _Documentation_: Improves or adds something to the documents.
- _Enhacement_: New feature or request.
- _Question_: further information wanted.

There are some other tags available that you can explore according to your needs. Some special tags like _prio:high_ shouldn't be used unless you are absolutely shure it is really important.
If the issue is very complicated please create it as a milestone. 

Before submmiting the issue:
- Check that the issue has not already been reported.
- Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code.
- Be clear, concise, and precise using grammatically correct, complete sentences in your summary of the problem.
- Include any relevant code in the issue.
