     - Allows general and specific comments on the line or lines that need to be reviewed.
     - Prevent merges to the master branch before the revision has been done
- Once a pull request has been selected, the project members MUST review the code and respond to the pull request giving any necessary feedback.
- Giving feedback mUST be open and collaborative, allowing external revision.
- The pull request MUST be revised by at least one of the proyect member.
- The feedback given SHOULD be brief and to the point, and MUST use neutral language. It MAY focus on the following areas:
     - Making sure the message description is clear and describes the objectives being addressed
     - Suggest changes needed 
     - Making sure the libraries and modules used in the code are relevant
     - Making sure comments in the code are adecuate
     - Check if tests of the change were included
