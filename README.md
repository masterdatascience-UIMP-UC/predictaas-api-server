# PredictaaS
There isn't any other machine learning solution on EOSC so, we pretend to be the centralized solution. With ML it is possible to respond to very different environmental and topical problems and treat large amounts of data in a simple way, giving access to powerful online computing tools that are otherwise difficult to access.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled aiohttp server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of aiohttp.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software
- Python 3.5.2+

### Installing
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/openapi.json
```

## Running the tests
To launch the integration tests, use pytest:
```
sudo pip install -r test-requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Built With

* [EGI Container Compute](https://www.egi.eu/services/cloud-container/)
* [EGI DataHub](https://www.egi.eu/services/datahub/)

## Prevent file overriding

After first generation, add edited files to _.openapi-generator-ignore_ to prevent generator to overwrite them. Typically:
```
server/controllers/*
test/*
*.txt
```
